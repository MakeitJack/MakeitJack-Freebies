Files are provided in `.3mf` format, compatible with most 3D printing slicer software (PrusaSlicer, Cura, etc.). You will need a 3D printer to use these models.

If you don't have a 3D printer, want to save time, or need a ready-made, high-quality item, you can purchase many of these models (and other lab equipment) directly from our store:
